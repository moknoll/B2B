   ![yes](./
5. We click on cancel, as the erasing of the data is not required.

6. Now again we need a passphrase for the LVM encrypt. Write this down aswell.
   ![pass_phrase](./Images/passphrase.png)
7. In this step we want to input max for the volume group during the guided partioning. You can type in the default aswell. 
   ![max](./Images/max.png)
8. To wrap the Partioning and write the changes to the disk choose Finish partioning
   ![finish_partioning](./Images/finish_partionig.png)
9. We choose yes and confirm that we do not want to change anything.

## 4.1 First Connection with VM
1. First of all connect by clicking on Debina GNI/Linux
   ![first](./Images/first.png)

2. Put in you passphrase we created earlier
   ![passphrase](./Images/first_commcetion)
3. Now type in your username and password for this user. It should now look like this.

## 4.2 Installing Sudo & Vim
1. We type in su. With this command we change to the "super user".
   ![sudo connect](./Images/sudo)
2. As we want to install sudo and vim we type in. We will now use apt, this is a collection of tools used to install, update, remove and otherwide manage software packages on Debian.
   ```
   apt install sudo && vim
   ```
3. After the installation we will reboot
   ```
   reboot
   ```
4. Once the machine is rebooted we have to do step 4.1 again. We switch to root again.
```
su
```
and then use this command, to check if sudo has been installed correctly
```
sudo -V
```

## 4.3 Configauration of groups
1. We will create a group called user42 which has to be present during the evaluation.
   ```
   sudo addgroup user42

   getent group <groupname>
   ```
Now you can see all groups and there members.

   ```
2. If you want to check if the installation was succesfull use
   ```
   sudo service ssh status
   ```
3. As we installed vim before. We can now open and configure the sshd_config file
   ```
   su
   vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
   ```
4. The # will mean that the line is commented; the lines we want to edit need to be uncommented
   ```
   # Port 22 -> Port 4242
   # PermitRootLogin prohibit-password -> PermitRootLogin no
   ```
5. To leave just press :wq to save in quit the file. What we have done no will be important later to connect remotely with our user but also not allowing to connect remotly with root.

6. Now we need to channge the file /etc/ssh/ssh_config (not sshd_config)
   ```
   vim /etc/ssh/ssh_config
   ```
   ```
   # Port22 -> Port4242
   ```
7. Then we will restart the ssh service and check that everything is correct 
   ```
   sudo service ssh restart
   ```
   ```
   sudo serveice ssh status
   ```
